It's getting hot with so many events from Ukrainian OWASP Chapters. Last month we had a great interview-style meetup, and we are ready again to bring you two awesome speakers.

Sam Stepanyan is an OWASP London Chapter Leader and an Independent Application Security Consultant with over 20 years of experience.
His talk is about the OWASP Nettacker Project, one of OWASP's "Unsung Hero" projects. Nettacker is a little-known yet awesome and powerful 'swiss-army-knife' type tool for information gathering and vulnerability scanning.

Volodymyr Nevmerzhytskyi has more than 6 years of experience in mobile app development, and as of right now, he is leading a banking app project.
In his talk, he will show us common mobile app vulnerabilities in real-life examples. He'll demonstrate how to fix them and protect from further attacks.
