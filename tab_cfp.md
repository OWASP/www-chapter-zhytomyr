### Call For Papers 2022

Call For Speakers at OWASP Zhytomyr events is permanently open. If you want
to present at future events simply send the title and abstract
of your talk and speaker bio to [Bohdan Nikitenko](mailto:bohdan.nikitenko@owasp.org) or [Julia Potapenko](mailto:julia.potapenko@owasp.org)
Due to the DGPR rules, we can't use Google forms anymore. So, we are testing the new CFP platform: [Apply Talk](https://sessionize.com/owasp-zhytomyr-1-2022/)
