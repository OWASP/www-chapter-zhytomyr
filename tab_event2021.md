Spring is here! And it means we celebrate OWASP Zhytomyr Birthday with an inspirational meetup. 

Let’s meet in a friendly atmosphere and discuss security with our special guest – Anastasi Vixentael. 

No slides and boring lectures. We’ll talk about "Security on your project from scratch". The questions from the audience will be very welcome! Join us on March 25, 19:30, online.
